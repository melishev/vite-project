### What is WSGO?

The WSGO library acts as an abstraction on top of a pure WebSocket connection. Think of it as:

- Socket.io, only without being tied to your server implementation
- Axios, just for WebSocket communication

WSGO is designed to standardize communication between client and server through an explicit and common communication format
